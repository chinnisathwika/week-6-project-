          You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand.
                Don't worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply;
                we'll all have our roads.

            <h3>Is taxation theft?</h3>
            <p>
             If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies,
            demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage
                of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized
                services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?

            <p>
             Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples
            can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.
                A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated
                with the highest respect.
